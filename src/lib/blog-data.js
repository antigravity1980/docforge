            ## Protecting Your Ideas
            In the early days of a startup, your most valuable asset is your idea and the unique way you execute it. When you're talking to potential partners, vendors, or early employees, you're often revealing sensitive information.

            ### What an NDA Actually Does
            A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) creates a confidential relationship between parties. It legally binds someone to keep your "secret sauce" a secret.

            ### Common Pitfalls
            1. **Being too broad:** If everything is confidential, nothing is.
            2. **Being too narrow:** Leaving out key parts of your business.
            3. **Mutual vs. One-way:** Choosing the wrong type for the situation.

            Using a tool like DocForge AI ensures you cover all the standard clauses required in a modern tech environment.

            ## Navigating Global Privacy Laws
            Privacy isn't just about security; it's about transparency. With the rise of GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California, businesses must be more careful than ever about how they handle user data.

            ### GDPR Highlights
            - Applies to anyone dealing with EU citizens.
            - Explicit consent is required.
            - "Right to be forgotten" is a core tenet.

            ### CCPA Highlights
            - Applies to businesses doing business in California.
            - Focuses on the "right to opt-out" of the sale of personal information.
            - Specific disclosure requirements in the footer of websites.

            ### Why You Need Both
            If you have a global audience, your Privacy Policy should ideally cover the stricter of the two or have specialized sections for each jurisdiction.
