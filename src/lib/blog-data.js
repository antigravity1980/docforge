Creating legal and business documents used to mean one of two things: hiring expensive lawyers or struggling with static, fill-in-the-blank templates that never quite fit your needs.

### 1. Speed and Efficiency
With DocForge AI, what used to take hours now takes seconds. You answer a few simple questions, and our AI drafts a comprehensive document tailored to your specific situation.

### 2. Cost-Effective
Lawyers charge hundreds of dollars per hour. Traditional template sites charge monthly fees for rigid documents. We offer a generous free tier and affordable plans that scale with you.

### 3. Customization at Scale
Static templates can't adapt to nuances. Our AI understands context. Need a freelance contract for a graphic designer in New York? Or an NDA for a software developer in Berlin? The AI adjusts the language accordingly.

### 4. Always Up-to-Date
Laws and business standards change. AI models are constantly trained on the latest information, ensuring your documents aren't stuck in the past.

### 5. Unified Dashboard
Manage all your contracts, invoices, and proposals in one place. No more lost files or scattered Google Docs.`

        content: `## Protecting Your Ideas
In the early days of a startup, your most valuable asset is your idea and the unique way you execute it. When you're talking to potential partners, vendors, or early employees, you're often revealing sensitive information.

### What an NDA Actually Does
A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) creates a confidential relationship between parties. It legally binds someone to keep your "secret sauce" a secret.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Being too broad:** If everything is confidential, nothing is.
2. **Being too narrow:** Leaving out key parts of your business.
3. **Mutual vs. One-way:** Choosing the wrong type for the situation.

Using a tool like DocForge AI ensures you cover all the standard clauses required in a modern tech environment.`

        content: `## Navigating Global Privacy Laws
Privacy isn't just about security; it's about transparency. With the rise of GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California, businesses must be more careful than ever about how they handle user data.

### GDPR Highlights
- Applies to anyone dealing with EU citizens.
- Explicit consent is required.
- "Right to be forgotten" is a core tenet.

### CCPA Highlights
- Applies to businesses doing business in California.
- Focuses on the "right to opt-out" of the sale of personal information.
- Specific disclosure requirements in the footer of websites.

### Why You Need Both
If you have a global audience, your Privacy Policy should ideally cover the stricter of the two or have specialized sections for each jurisdiction.`
